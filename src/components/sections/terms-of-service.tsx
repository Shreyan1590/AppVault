          <h2>2. Changes to Terms or Services</h2>
          <p>
            We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we
            do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on
            the site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
